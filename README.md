betacoinpaperwallet
===================

Betacoin Paper Wallet based on BitAddress.org

Hasn't been 100% tested. I have tested the Single Wallet and Paper Wallet addresses and private keys and they import successfully into my betacoin wallet

Syntax is:

importprivkey 'NJB......3QQYksnnN789631Se3ds7Y8eL.....NrFKz8UCNDPJ' 'label'

To check it imported, you can rerun betacoind or betacoin-qt with -rescan to import the funds.

Haven't tested Bulk Wallets, but the addresses generated appear to be fine.

Untested:
=========

Vanity wallet (maybe some other time)
Brain wallet (anyone?)
